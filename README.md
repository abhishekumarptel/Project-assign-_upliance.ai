The objective of this project is to analyze datasets related to user behavior,cooking preferences, and order trends.
Worked with three datasets: UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails.
The task involves cleaning and merging the data, analyzing the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders, identifying popular dishes, and exploring demographic factors that influence user behavior.
Additionally,  created some visualizations to showcase key insights using charts and write a report to summarizing our insights and business recommendations.
